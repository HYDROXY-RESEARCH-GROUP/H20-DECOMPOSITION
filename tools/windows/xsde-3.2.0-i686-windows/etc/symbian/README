This file describes how to build and use XSD/e with Symbian.

The first step is to create the XSD/e configuration for your version
of the Symbian SDK. Copy the config.make file found in this directory
to the config/ subdirectory of the XSD/e distribution. Then build your
Symbian application with the -v abld option to see the actual C++ 
compiler command lines being executed. For example:

abld -v build gcce urel

Copy the compiler options used to build your application to the
config/config.make. You would normally put -I, -D, and -include options
to the CPPFLAGS variable and all the other options to the CFLAGS and
CXXFLAGS variable (they normally will be identical or near identical).
You will also need to adjust the SDKROOT and GCCEROOT variables.

Once this is done, in a terminal or command prompt change to the
libxsde directory and run make to build the XSD/e runtime library
(libxsde.a). On Windows, GNU make can be found in the epoc32/tools/
subdirectory of the Symbian SDK.

If you get a compile error saying that the <new> header file is not
found, then copy the 'new' file found in this directory to libxsde/ and
run make again.

Once the XSD/e runtime library is built, compile your schemas to C++ with
the XSD/e compiler (bin/xsde) and add the resulting generated C++ files to
your Symbian project. You will also need to add the libxsde directory to
your project's header search paths (-I option) and link to libxsde.a.
