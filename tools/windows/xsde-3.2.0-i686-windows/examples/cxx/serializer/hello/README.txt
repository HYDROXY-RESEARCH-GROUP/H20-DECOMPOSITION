This is a "Hello, world!" example that shows how to use the
Embedded C++/Serializer mapping to serialize XML documents.

The example consists of the following files:

hello.xsd
  XML Schema which describes "hello" instance documents.

hello-sskel.hxx
hello-sskel.ixx
hello-sskel.cxx
  Serializer skeletons generated by XSD/e from hello.xsd.

driver.cxx
  A serializer implementation and a driver for the example.
  The serializer implementation simply creates an XML
  document with pre-defined data. The driver first constructs
  a serializer instance from the serializer implementation
  mentioned above and a couple of predefined serializers for
  the XML Schema built-in types. In then invokes this serializer
  instance to write the XML document to STDOUT.

To run the example simply execute:

$ ./driver
