This example shows how to use the sample implementation and test
driver generation feature of the Embedded C++/Parser mapping. This
example does not have any hand-written C++ code; everything is
generated by the XSD/e compiler.

The example consists of the following files:

library.xsd
  XML Schema which describes a library of books.

library.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

library-pskel.hxx
library-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by XSD/e from library.xsd.

library-pimpl.hxx
library-pimpl.cxx
  Sample parser implementations that print the XML data to STDOUT.
  These are generated by XSD/e from library.xsd with the
  --generate-print-impl option.

library-pdriver.cxx
  Sample driver for the example. It is generated by XSD/e from
  library.xsd with the --generate-test-driver option.


To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply
execute:

$ ./library-pdriver library.xml

The example reads from STDIN if input file is not specified:

$ ./library-pdriver <library.xml
