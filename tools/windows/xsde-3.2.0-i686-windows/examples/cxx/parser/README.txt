This directory contains a number of examples that show how to use the
Embedded C++/Parser mapping. The following list gives an overview of
each example. See the README files in example directories for more
information on each example.

hello
  A simple "Hello, world!" example that shows how to parse XML
  documents.

generated
  Shows how to use the sample implementation and test driver
  generation feature. This example does not have any hand-written
  C++ code; everything is generated by the XSD/e compiler.

library
  Shows how to handle more complex data structures and construct
  a custom in-memory object model.

minimal
  This example is a minimal parser implementation that is
  intended to work without STL, iostream, or C++ exceptions.

wildcard
  Shows how to parse XML data matched by XML Schema wildcards (any
  and anyAttribute).

multiroot
  Shows how to handle XML vocabularies with multiple root elements.

mixed
  Shows how to handle raw, "type-less content" such as mixed content
  models, anyType/anySimpleType, and any/anyAttribute.

polymorphism
  Shows how to handle XML vocabularies that use XML Schema polymorphism
  features such as the xsi:type attribute and substitution groups.

polyroot
  Shows how to handle XML vocabularies with polymorphic document root 
  elements.
