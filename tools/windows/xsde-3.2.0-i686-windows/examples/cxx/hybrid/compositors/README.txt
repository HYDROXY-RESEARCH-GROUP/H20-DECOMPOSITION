This example shows how to create, access, and modify object models with
complex nested choice and sequence compositors in the Embedded C++/Hybrid
mapping.

For more information about nested compositors see Section 4.4, "Compositors"
in the Embedded C++/Hybrid Mapping Getting Started Guide.


The example consists of the following files:

compositors.xsd
  XML Schema which defines a number of types with nested compositors.

compositors.hxx
compositors.cxx

  Object model classes. These are generated by the XSD/e compiler from
  compositors.xsd.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It shows how to create, access, and modify object
  models that use nested choice and sequence compositors. The driver does
  not produce any output.
  

To run the example simply execute:

$ ./driver
